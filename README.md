Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. This data analysis project helps Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries.
## Objectives
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board expects data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
